<h1 align="center">ðŸ’‹ Fayebot</h1>
<p align="center">A bot framework tenderly written in Moonscript</p>

### Summary
Fayebot is a general bot framework originally forked from [leafo's bot](https://github.com/leafo/saltw-bot), but it takes heavy implementation influence from [moon-moon](https://github.com/wiseguiz/Moon-Moon) and architectural influence from [munar](https://github.com/welovekpop/munar). While it currently shares a Moonscript/Lapis base and a focus on irc, Fayebot looks to provide a robust framework for plugins to interope connections with a variety of other chat services. Another intention for Fayebot is a strong AI for a variety of games (in particular Riichi Mahjong because I want another option from Tenhou).

### Features
Fayebot is divided into three parts:
* `core`: an event loop that listens and outputs
* `adapters`: an implementation of a listener
* `plugins`: an implementation of an output

### Goals
* Add Games
    * Riichi
        * make rules and validators
